                    My name is Masayuki Fujita. Thank you for taking your time to visit my webpage. On this particular page, I&apos;m going to write a little bit about myself, along with some of my favorite music pieces. This page won&apos;t have much (any?) practical information; instead this page is more about who I am as a person, mainly about my passion for engineering and music.

                    Ever since I can remember, I have always loved making things. In kindergarten, my parents would keep old cardbord boxes, toiletpaper cores, milk cartons for me to repurpose into imaginative objects like bookshelves and my &ldquo;automatic sushi deployer&rdquo; (which, admittedly, was neither automatic nor a &ldquo;sushi deployer&rdquo;).

                    My passion for creation continued. At age ten, I won an award by Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation for creating automatic page-turner for piano. Around this time is also when I discovered a book about programming and math in my family&apos;s bookshelf. It was bought by my father, who, to this day still has not read it. I vividly remember flipping through the book and typing the BASIC code printed in the book, being electrified to realize all the possiblilities of this new tool, called programming, that I just acquired.

                    As I grew older, my fascination with music deepened. Learning the trombone alongside piano, I was exposed to more orchestral pieces as well as chamber pieces. The experience of listening to and performing classical music is something I wouldn&apos;t trade for anything. I was fortunate enough to hold leadership roles within my orchestra, guiding them musically.

                    Whether it&apos;s music or software or cardboard projects, I realized that the common thread that transpires throughout all my life experiences is that I really enjoy creating something nice. I think that is at the core of my identity. So no matter what the future holds, I will be always making something, small or big, trying to make it as nice as possible.
